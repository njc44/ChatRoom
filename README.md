# ChatRoom

A Simple Socket.io Chat Room application using NodeJS, MongoDB and HTML created by me!

To run, download the files, upload them on visual studio and use the following cmds on its terminal

npm install
npm start

Then just go on to open the HTML file with Google chrome or any web browser on two or more tabs and enjoy chatting!(With yourself for the time being :P)
